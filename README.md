# maddening-march-model
This is a Machine Learning (ML) model designed to create a prediction on who can potentially be the champions for the 2023 NCAA March Madness tournament. To create a prediction, the model will use data from a list of selected metrics. These metrics will include the following:

- Scores from past games: Analyzing past performance can offer valuable insights into a team's ability to perform well in the tournament.
- Coach tenure for each school: A coach's experience and track record can significantly impact a team's performance and strategy during the games.
- The distance from a team's campus to the stadium the match is being held: Travel distance can affect players' physical and mental states, potentially impacting their performance.
- Previous scores from historical matchup data from 1985 to 2023: Examining historical data helps identify patterns, trends, and strengths or weaknesses of the participating teams over time.
