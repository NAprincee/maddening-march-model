## Introduction
This is a Machine Learning (ML) model designed to create a prediction on who can potentially be the champions for the 2023 NCAA March Madness tournament. To create a prediction, the model will use data from a list of selected metrics. These metrics will include the following:

1) Current seasons team stats: Analyzing past performance can offer valuable insights into a team's ability to perform well in the tournament.
2) Historical seasons team stats from 2008 to 2023: Examining historical data helps identify patterns, trends, and strengths or weaknesses of the participating teams over time.

## R Script Directory
* Data cleaning and matchup predictions - QueryScript.R
* Shiny app and visualizations - app.r

## Dictionary
*The following entries are the popular methods used amongst college basketball to calculate various team stats which are present in our work*
* Kenpom: The purpose of this system is to show how strong a team would be if it played tonight, independent of injuries or emotional factors
* Barttorvik: Very similar to Kenpom but different in that it attempts to account for the various factors that kenpom is independent to
* Barthag: Represents the chance a team has of beating any average Division 1 team in the country

## Data Cleaning
* Create a valid date column in our dataset
```r
df_tournament <- df_tournament %>%
  mutate(Day = lubridate::day(as.Date(DayNum, origin = paste0(Season, "-01-01")))) %>%
  mutate(Month = lubridate::month(as.Date(DayNum, origin = paste0(Season, "-01-01")))) %>%
  mutate(Date =  as.Date(paste(Season, Month, Day, sep = "/"))) %>%
  select(Date, Season, Month, Day, everything(), -DayNum)
  ```
 
 * Left join team names into our dataset as opposed to using the teams ID
 ```r
 df_historical_data <- df_tournament %>%
  left_join(df_teams_id_name, by = c("WTeamID" = "TeamID")) %>%
  select(-FirstD1Season, -LastD1Season) %>%
  rename(WTeam = TeamName) %>%
  left_join(df_teams_id_name, by = c("LTeamID" = "TeamID")) %>%
  select(-FirstD1Season, -LastD1Season, -WLoc) %>%
  rename(LTeam = TeamName)
  ```
  
  * Seperate historical teams stats from current seasons team stats (Kenpom, Barttorvik, Barthag)
  ```r
  df_team_data_historical <- filter(df_team_data, YEAR != 2023)
  ```

## SVM Model Functions
* Define the range of parameter values to search
```r
 tune_params <- list(
   kernel = c("linear", "polynomial", "radial", "sigmoid"),
   gamma = c(0.1, 1, 5, 10),
   cost = c(0.1, 1, 10, 100)
 )
 ```
 * Perform a grid search with 5-fold cross-validation
 ```r
  tune_result <- tune(
   svm, 
   CHAMPION ~ . -YEAR -SEED -ROUND -TEAM, 
   data = df_team_data_historical,
   ranges = tune_params,
   tunecontrol = tune.control(cross = 5)
 )
 ```
 * Train the model with the best parameters
 ```r
 tournament_model <- svm(CHAMPION ~ . -YEAR -SEED -ROUND -TEAM, 
                        data = df_team_data_historical,
                        kernel = tune_result$best.parameters$kernel, 
                        gamma = tune_result$best.parameters$gamma, 
                        cost = tune_result$best.parameters$cost)
```
* Make predictions on the test set
```r
predictions <- predict(tournament_model, df_current_team_data)
```

## March Madness 2023 Predictions
* To create the bracket within R studio we created keys within which to group teams (REGION, SEED, MATCHUP.KEY, GAME.KEY). 
* To determine a winner of the matchup we compared the two teams models results and whosever was higher advanced to the next round
```r
df_matchup_predictions <- df_matchup_predictions %>%
  left_join(df_champions, by = c("TEAM" = "TEAM")) 
  
df_matchup_predictions_first_round <- df_matchup_predictions %>%
  select(REGION, MATCHUP.KEY, GAME.KEY, TEAM, SEED, PREDICTIONS) %>%
  arrange( REGION, MATCHUP.KEY, GAME.KEY) %>%
  mutate(WINNER = PREDICTIONS > lead(PREDICTIONS))
```
