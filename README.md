## Introduction ‚ñ∂
This is a Machine Learning (ML) model designed to create a prediction on who can potentially be the champions for the 2023 NCAA March Madness tournament. To create a prediction, the model will use data from a list of selected metrics. These metrics will include the following:

1) Current seasons team stats: Analyzing past performance can offer valuable insights into a team's ability to perform well in the tournament.
2) Historical seasons team stats from 2008 to 2023: Examining historical data helps identify patterns, trends,strengths, and weaknesses of participating teams over time.

A working version of this app has been published and hosted through Shinyapps.io, and is accessible via the link below.

## R Script Directory üìú
*The folowing are two R srcipts that were used to clean data, create matchup predictions, and visualization through the use of a Shiny application.*
* Data cleaning and matchup predictions - QueryScript.R
* Shiny app and visualizations - app.r

## Dictionary üìï
*The following entries are the popular methods used amongst college basketball to calculate various team stats, which are present in our work.*
* Kenpom: This system demostrates how strong a team would be if it played tonight, independent of injuries or emotional factors
* Barttorvik: Very similar to Kenpom, but different in that it attempts to account for the various factors that Kenpom is independent from
* Barthag: Represents the chance a team has of beating any average Division 1 team in the country

## Data Cleaning üßπ
*The following examples of code were used to perform the necessary data cleaning and organization to ensure the input data is relevent and optimized for use by the SVM. These processes include creating valid date columns, replacing team ID numbers with their respective names, and seperating out current season and past season statistics.*
1) Tournament Data

* Create a valid date column in our dataset
```r
df_tournament <- df_tournament %>%
  mutate(Day = lubridate::day(as.Date(DayNum, origin = paste0(Season, "-01-01")))) %>%
  mutate(Month = lubridate::month(as.Date(DayNum, origin = paste0(Season, "-01-01")))) %>%
  mutate(Date =  as.Date(paste(Season, Month, Day, sep = "/"))) %>%
  select(Date, Season, Month, Day, everything(), -DayNum)
  ```
 2) Historical Data
 
 * Left join team names into our dataset as opposed to using the teams ID
 ```r
 df_historical_data <- df_tournament %>%
  left_join(df_teams_id_name, by = c("WTeamID" = "TeamID")) %>%
  select(-FirstD1Season, -LastD1Season) %>%
  rename(WTeam = TeamName) %>%
  left_join(df_teams_id_name, by = c("LTeamID" = "TeamID")) %>%
  select(-FirstD1Season, -LastD1Season, -WLoc) %>%
  rename(LTeam = TeamName)
  ```
  3) Data Filtering
  
  * Seperate historical teams stats from the current season's team stats (Kenpom, Barttorvik, Barthag)
  ```r
  df_team_data_historical <- filter(df_team_data, YEAR != 2023)
  ```

## SVM Model Functions üßÆ
*The following examples of code were used to organized the data to be utilized by our SVM. Once the data was selected, we needed to train the SVM with the data in order to accurately make predications within the given parameters. In addition, after the SVM was trained, we performed a test to ensure the predication process was performing as intended.*

1) Set Parameters

* Define the range of parameter values to search in the SVM
```r
 tune_params <- list(
   kernel = c("linear", "polynomial", "radial", "sigmoid"),
   gamma = c(0.1, 1, 5, 10),
   cost = c(0.1, 1, 10, 100)
 )
 ```
 
 2) Grid Search
 
 * Perform a grid search with 5-fold cross-validation
 ```r
  tune_result <- tune(
   svm, 
   CHAMPION ~ . -YEAR -SEED -ROUND -TEAM, 
   data = df_team_data_historical,
   ranges = tune_params,
   tunecontrol = tune.control(cross = 5)
 )
 ```
 
 3) Model Training
 
 * Train the model with the best parameters
 ```r
 tournament_model <- svm(CHAMPION ~ . -YEAR -SEED -ROUND -TEAM, 
                        data = df_team_data_historical,
                        kernel = tune_result$best.parameters$kernel, 
                        gamma = tune_result$best.parameters$gamma, 
                        cost = tune_result$best.parameters$cost)
```
4) Model Testing

* Make predictions on the test set
```r
predictions <- predict(tournament_model, df_current_team_data)
```

## March Madness 2023 Predictions üìà
*Once the SVM was trained and testing was completed, the model was tasked with generating predictions for all 6 rounds of the Championship. Each round, the model would narrow down the brackets based on comparing statistics from the two teams placed within the brackets by the model.*

1) Matchup Bracket

* To create the bracket within R studio we created keys within which to group teams (REGION, SEED, MATCHUP.KEY, GAME.KEY). 
```r
df_matchup_predictions <- df_matchup_predictions %>%
  left_join(df_champions, by = c("TEAM" = "TEAM"))
```
2) Macthups Per Round

* To determine a winner of the matchup, we compared the two teams models results and whicher team scored higher advanced to the next round
```r  
df_matchup_predictions_first_round <- df_matchup_predictions %>%
  select(REGION, MATCHUP.KEY, GAME.KEY, TEAM, SEED, PREDICTIONS) %>%
  arrange( REGION, MATCHUP.KEY, GAME.KEY) %>%
  mutate(WINNER = PREDICTIONS > lead(PREDICTIONS))
```
3) Write .csv File for Matchups during each Round

* Create data frames for each round
```r
write_csv(df_matchup_predictions_first_round,"Data/firstRound.csv")
write_csv(df_matchup_predictions_second_round, "Data/secondRound.csv")
write_csv(df_matchup_predictions_third_round, "Data/thirdRound.csv")
```
4) Read .csv File for each Round

* Use data frames for each matchup to determine the winning teams for each consecutive round, first round serving as an example
```r
df_first_round <- read.csv('Data/firstRound.csv') %>%
  mutate(UNIVERSAL.KEY = GAME.KEY)
```
